# Project Overview

This project models a drone-based delivery system designed to improve efficiency in last-mile urban logistics. Last-mile delivery refers to the final stage of the supply chain, where goods are transported from a local hub to the customer’s door. Although it is the shortest part of the delivery process, it is often the most complex and expensive due to factors such as traffic congestion, frequent stops, and the need for individualized deliveries in urban environments.

To address these challenges, companies are increasingly exploring solutions such as drone delivery to improve speed and reduce operational costs. Our system focuses on organizing and optimizing drone operations while ensuring safety and reliability through structured data management.


# System Focus and Objectives 

The primary focus of this system is:
- Fleet maintenance  
- Route optimization  

Our goal is to design a system that keeps drone delivery operations efficient, safe, and scalable by enforcing key constraints such as drone status validation, maintenance tracking, and charging station limitations.

# Business Rules

The system enforces the following rules:

1. Drones must have a valid status (In-Flight, Charging, Maintenance) before being assigned to a trip.  
2. Maintenance logs must be created when a drone exceeds 50 flight hours.  
3. Charging stations can only serve one drone at a time, with start and end times recorded.


# Data Model
<img width="1270" height="801" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-02 215114" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae8f091-7f6f-4a00-97c3-cb9eb8acadf8" />

The data model illustrates how drones, trips, packages, and supporting entities interact to manage delivery operations and enforce system constraints.

At the center of the system is the Drone entity, which connects operational activity with maintenance and resource management. Each drone can complete many trips, accumulate maintenance logs over time, and participate in charging sessions. This allows the system to track both performance and upkeep, ensuring that drones remain reliable for delivery operations.

A Storage_Facility serves as the operational hub, housing both drones and technicians. One facility can support many drones and many technicians, creating a structured environment for both deployment and maintenance. Technicians generate maintenance logs for drones, allowing the system to monitor servicing and enforce maintenance requirements based on flight hours.

On the delivery side, the system connects warehouses, routes, trips, and packages to represent how goods move through the network. A warehouse can store many packages and support multiple routes. Each route can be used for many trips, and each trip is assigned to one drone. Packages are linked to trips through the Trip_Packages table, which represents a many-to-many relationship. This allows a single trip to carry multiple packages while maintaining flexibility in delivery assignments.

Shipping destinations are connected to packages to represent delivery endpoints, while routes ensure that trips follow structured and optimized paths. Together, these relationships allow the system to efficiently coordinate deliveries across an urban environment.

The model also supports key operational constraints. Charging stations and charging sessions track when and where drones are charging, ensuring that only one drone occupies a station at a given time. In addition, maintenance logs track drone usage and enforce servicing once flight-hour thresholds are exceeded. These constraints help maintain safety and prevent operational conflicts.

# Simple Queries:

## List every drone's ID, status, battery level, and total flight hours.

### Managerial Explanation: This query gives managers a quick snapshot of the current condition of the fleet by showing each drone’s status, battery level, and flight hours. It helps support day-to-day operational decisions by showing which drones may be available, which may need attention soon, and which are approaching maintenance thresholds.

#### SELECT Drone.droneID, Drone.status, Drone.battery, Drone.flightHours FROM Drone;
<img width="394" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01714170-e013-42b6-8f09-1390ac0ec179" />

## For every drone that has surpassed 50 flight hours, list its ID, total flight hours, and status.

### Managerial Explanation: This query helps managers identify drones that have exceeded the maintenance threshold and may require servicing. It is useful for preventative maintenance planning, reducing the risk of equipment failure, and making sure the fleet remains safe and reliable during delivery operations.

#### SELECT Drone.droneID, Drone.flightHours, Drone.status FROM Drone WHERE Drone.flightHours > 50;

## List the package ID, type, weight, and contenets for every trip.

### Managerial Explanation: This query helps managers understand how packages are being distributed across trips. It is useful for monitoring package loads, verifying that delivery assignments are being made correctly, and evaluating whether trips are being used efficiently to carry multiple deliveries at once.

#### SELECT Trip_Packages.Trip_TripID, Packages.packageID,  Packages.packageType, Packages.weight, Packages.packageContent FROM Trip_Packages JOIN Packages ON Trip_Packages.Packages_packageID = Packages.packageID;

<img width="656" height="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be83f28-4f71-4607-9b51-bf8fd4d75a40" />

## List the total distance flown by every drone.

### Managerial Explanation: This query allows managers to measure how heavily each drone is being used by showing the total distance it has traveled. It helps with workload balancing, identifying high-use drones, planning maintenance more effectively, and evaluating whether fleet usage is being distributed efficiently.

#### SELECT Trip.Drone_droneID, SUM(Trip.tripDistance) AS total_distance_flown FROM Trip GROUP BY Trip.Drone_droneID;

<img width="413" height="230" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0bba2ff-25ff-47ae-9134-513ae0c88e36" />

# Complex Queries 

## Categorize every drone in flight into categories: if battery level is above 67, it is "good to go." If it is below 67 or below but above 33, list it as "Monitor Battery." If it is lower than 33, list it as "Charge soon."

### Managerial Explanation: This query helps managers quickly evaluate which active drones are in strong condition and which may need charging soon. Instead of only showing a battery number, it translates battery levels into more practical categories, making it easier to prioritize operational decisions and respond quickly when a drone may need to leave service for charging.

#### SELECT *, CASE     WHEN battery > 67 THEN "Good to go"       WHEN battery > 33 THEN "Monitor Battery" WHEN battery <= 32 THEN "Charge Soon" END AS BatteryLevel FROM Drone WHERE status = "In-Flight";

<img width="872" height="102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64bd169e-1daa-423f-b661-4983b993598a" />

## List the drone ID, status, facility address, average speed in miles per minute, and current battery level for faster than average drones with a battery level above 70. 

### Managerial Explanation: This query is to be used in emergencies, such as same-day-delivery orders or medical emergencies than might need a certain medicine delivered ASAP. It shows managers all the relevant information they might need to decide what drone to use to make those urgent deliveries, such as their battery level and where they're located at the moment. Managers can choose the fastest drone closest to the warehouse where the package is stored to make the delivery.

#### SELECT Drone_droneID, Drone.status, facilityAddress, AVG(tripDistance/tripLength) AS avg_drone_mpm, battery FROM Drone JOIN storage_facility ON facilityID = `Storage Facility_facilityID`JOIN Trip ON Drone_droneID = droneID WHERE battery > 70 GROUP BY Drone_droneID, Drone.status, facilityAddress HAVING avg_drone_mpm < (SELECT AVG(tripDistance/tripLength) FROM Trip) ORDER BY avg_drone_mpm DESC;

## This query calculates how many packages each warehouse has handled and the total weight of those packages, then ranks the warehouses from highest to lowest activity, for warehouses that have handled at least one package.

### Managerial Explanation: This query helps management evaluate warehouse activity by showing how many packages each warehouse has handled and the total weight processed. It is useful for comparing warehouse workload, identifying high-volume locations, and supporting decisions related to staffing, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.

#### SELECT Warehouse.warehouseID, COUNT(Packages.packageID) AS TotalPackagesHandled, SUM(Packages.weight) AS TotalWeightHandled FROM Warehouse JOIN Packages ON Warehouse.warehouseID = Packages.Warehouse_warehouseID GROUP BY Warehouse.warehouseID ORDER BY TotalPackagesHandled DESC;

## SUB QUERY: Drones with above average flight hours 
### Managerial Explanation: This query helps managers identify drones that are being used more heavily than the rest of the fleet. It is useful for spotting overutilized assets, determining which drones may need closer monitoring, and making better decisions about balancing usage across the fleet.

#### SELECT Drone.droneID, Drone.flightHours FROM Drone WHERE Drone.flightHours > ( SELECT AVG(Drone.flightHours) FROM Drone);

<img width="250" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4282411-8081-460a-9203-cf4e81eecc9f" />

## List the ID and name of technicians who haven't serviced any maintenance log in 2026.

### Managerial Explanation: This helps managers identify maintenance workers who haven't operated on any drones in 2026. This will help clear the database of workers who have been laid off but yet removed from the system or who haven't been coming to work.

#### SELECT Technicians.technicianID, Technicians.techniciansFName, Technicians.techniciansLName FROM Technicians WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM maintenance_logs WHERE maintenance_logs.Technicians_technicianID = Technicians.technicianID AND maintenanceDate > '2026-01-01 00:00:00');

<img width="458" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f794a8f7-d5aa-463a-9596-5607adba1b5e" />

## List the total trips taken, distance covered, average trip distance, drones used, and total packages delivered in every area code. For each area code, give it a status based on its current trip-to-drone ratio. If it has above a 5-1 TTD ratio, give it the status, "Needs more drones." If the number of trips taken is greater than 5, label it "Monitor demand." Else, label it "Current Capacity is Fine." 

### Managerial Explanation: This query helps management see which service areas are busiest, how far drones are traveling in those areas, how many packages are being delivered, and how many drones are currently being used there. It also adds a demand label so managers can quickly spot areas that may need more drone support in the future.
#### SELECT Route.areaCode, COUNT(Trip.tripID) AS TotalTrips, SUM(Trip.tripDistance) AS TotalDistance, AVG(Trip.tripDistance) AS AvgTripDistance, COUNT(DISTINCT Trip.Drone_droneID) AS DronesUsed, COUNT(Packages.packageID) AS TotalPackages, CASE     WHEN COUNT(Trip.tripID) >= 10 AND COUNT(DISTINCT Trip.Drone_droneID) <= 2 THEN 'Needs More Drones'    WHEN COUNT(Trip.tripID) >= 5 THEN 'Monitor Demand' ELSE 'Current Capacity is Fine' END AS AreaDemandStatus FROM Route LEFT JOIN Trip    ON Route.routeID = Trip.Route_routeID LEFT JOIN Trip_Packages     ON Trip.tripID = Trip_Packages.Trip_TripID LEFT JOIN Packages     ON Trip_Packages.Packages_packageID = Packages.packageID GROUP BY Route.areaCode HAVING COUNT(Trip.tripID) > 0 ORDER BY TotalTrips DESC, TotalDistance DESC;
